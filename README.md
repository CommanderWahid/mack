## Setup

Install mack with `pip install mack`.

Here's an example of how you can perform a Type 2 SCD upsert with a single line of code using Mack:

```python
import mack

mack.type_2_scd_upsert(path, updatesDF, "pkey", ["attr1", "attr2"])
```

## Type 2 SCD Upserts

This library provides an opinionated, conventions over configuration, approach to Type 2 SCD management.  Let's look at an example before covering the conventions required to take advantage of the functionality.

Suppose you have the following SCD table with the `pkey` primary key:

```
+----+-----+-----+----------+-------------------+--------+
|pkey|attr1|attr2|is_current|     effective_time|end_time|
+----+-----+-----+----------+-------------------+--------+
|   1|    A|    A|      true|2019-01-01 00:00:00|    null|
|   2|    B|    B|      true|2019-01-01 00:00:00|    null|
|   4|    D|    D|      true|2019-01-01 00:00:00|    null|
+----+-----+-----+----------+-------------------+--------+
```

You'd like to perform an upsert with this data:

```
+----+-----+-----+-------------------+
|pkey|attr1|attr2|     effective_time|
+----+-----+-----+-------------------+
|   2|    Z| null|2020-01-01 00:00:00| // upsert data
|   3|    C|    C|2020-09-15 00:00:00| // new pkey
+----+-----+-----+-------------------+
```

Here's how to perform the upsert:

```scala
mack.type_2_scd_upsert(path, updatesDF, "pkey", ["attr1", "attr2"])
```

Here's the table after the upsert:

```
+----+-----+-----+----------+-------------------+-------------------+
|pkey|attr1|attr2|is_current|     effective_time|           end_time|
+----+-----+-----+----------+-------------------+-------------------+
|   2|    B|    B|     false|2019-01-01 00:00:00|2020-01-01 00:00:00|
|   4|    D|    D|      true|2019-01-01 00:00:00|               null|
|   1|    A|    A|      true|2019-01-01 00:00:00|               null|
|   3|    C|    C|      true|2020-09-15 00:00:00|               null|
|   2|    Z| null|      true|2020-01-01 00:00:00|               null|
+----+-----+-----+----------+-------------------+-------------------+
```

You can leverage the upsert code if your SCD table meets these requirements:

* Contains a unique primary key column
* Any change in an attribute column triggers an upsert
* SCD logic is exposed via `effective_time`, `end_time` and `is_current` column (you can also use date or version columns for SCD upserts)
